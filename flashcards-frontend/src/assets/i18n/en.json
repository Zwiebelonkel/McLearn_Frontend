  "leitner_text": "The Leitner Algorithm is a learning method based on flashcards. It was proposed by Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s. The flashcards are organized into boxes. At the beginning, all flashcards are in the first box. If you know the answer to a flashcard, it is moved to the next box. If you donâ€™t know the answer, it is moved back to the first box. In this way, you review the difficult flashcards more frequently than the easy ones.",
  "howto_title": "How to Use the App",
  "howto_text": "The app is a simple flashcard application. You can create decks of flashcards. A deck is a collection of flashcards. You can edit a deck to add, delete, or modify flashcards. You can also study a deck. When you study a deck, the Leitner Algorithm is used to decide which flashcard to show next. You can also view your progress for each deck.",
